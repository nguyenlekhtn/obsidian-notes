1. **Plan the Data Model**:
    - Determine how you will model the follow relationship between users (e.g., a separate "Relationship" model or a self-referencing association on the User model).
    - Decide what data needs to be stored (e.g., follower_id, followed_id, timestamps).
2. **Create the Database Migration(s)**:
    - Generate the migration(s) to create the necessary table(s) for storing follow relationships.
    - Define the columns and associations in the migration(s).
3. **Define Model Associations**:
    - In the User model, define the associations required for following and being followed.
    - This may involve has_many, has_many through, and belongs_to associations.
4. **Implement Follow/Unfollow Functionality**:
    - Add methods to the User model to allow following and unfollowing another user.
    - These methods should create or destroy the necessary relationship records.
5. **Add Routes and Controller Actions**:
    - Define routes for following and unfollowing users.
    - Create controller actions to handle the follow and unfollow requests.
6. **Create Views for Following/Unfollowing**:
    - Add view elements (e.g., buttons, links) that allow users to follow or unfollow other users.
    - These could be on the user profile pages or elsewhere in the application.
7. **Display Following/Follower Information**:
    - On user profile pages (or elsewhere), display the list of users the current user is following.
    - Also, display the list of users who are following the current user.
8. **Implement Access Controls**:
    - Ensure that only authenticated users can follow or unfollow other users.
    - Restrict access to follow/unfollow actions based on the current user's relationship status.
9. **Write Tests**:
    - Create unit and integration tests to ensure the follow/unfollow functionality works as expected.
    - Test various scenarios, such as following, unfollowing, checking follower/following lists, and access controls.
10. **Refine and Style**:
    - Review the implementation and refine the code as needed.
    - Style the follow/unfollow elements and related views to match the application's design.
